# Requirements:
#     Xerces library: http://xerces.apache.org/
# Notes:
#     Since there is not standard cmake module to find the xerces library
#     we provide one with this distribution. It should be able to find
#     the library from the XERCES_ROOT cmake variable. Standard layout, as
#     with the binary packages from apache is assumed.
# If you find any errors or have suggestion to improve the build script:
# patches are most welcome! Please send them to the development mailing list.
